## ðŸ“š About:
This is my first coding project ever! 
I created a little portfolio that summarize what I have been doing for the past years. 
Here a non comprehensive list of what you will find:
<ol> 
<li>A <i>Home Page</i> with a nav bar, a background image and two buttons;</li>
<li>Three more pages: <i>Career</i>, <i>Life</i> and <i>Contacts</i>;</li>
<li>The style.css file is simple and well organized: it contains mainly some paddings and margins. The media query tags make it fully responsive.</li>

</ol>
